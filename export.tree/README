# Disarming emotional memories using Targeted Memory Reactivation during Rapid Eye Movement sleep

This dataset contains fMRI and EEG data from a study investigating the effects of Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) during REM sleep on emotional reactivity. 

## Study Design

Participants rated the arousal of 48 affective images paired with semantically matching sounds. Half of these sounds were cued during REM in the subsequent overnight sleep cycle. Participants rated the images in an MRI scanner with pulse oximetry 48 hours after encoding, and again two weeks later.

### Sessions
1. Baseline: Initial arousal ratings and overnight sleep with TMR
2. Session 48-H: fMRI scanning and arousal ratings (48 hours after baseline)
3. Session 2-Wk: Online follow-up (2 weeks after baseline)

## Data Acquisition

- **fMRI**: Acquired using a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner with a 32-channel head coil
- **Heart Rate**: Recorded using pulse oximetry during the fMRI session3
- EEG data from the overnight sleep session

## Dataset Contents

This initial upload contains:
- T1-weighted structural images
- Functional MRI data from Session 48-H
- B0 field maps

## Preprocessing

fMRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 20.2.7. Details of the preprocessing pipeline can be found in the methods section of the associated publication.

T1-weighted structural scans were defaced using pydeface version 2.0.2 to ensure participant anonymity.

This dataset was initially converted to BIDS format using ezBIDS (https://brainlife.io/ezbids).
